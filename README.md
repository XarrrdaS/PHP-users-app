# PHP app - users table with remove and add functionality
The app uses jQuery to handle AJAX requests.<br>
Application retrieves data (users) from a JSON file.<br>
Through the form you can add new user to JSON.<br>
Pressing a button on a specific row for specific user, will remove him from the JSON file.<br>
Application also updates the ID in the JSON file when a new user is removed or added to keep everything in order
